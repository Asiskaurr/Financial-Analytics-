# Financial Analytics

This project explores financial datasets to derive insights into revenue drivers and business performance using data analytics and predictive modeling.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Regression Models, Correlation Analysis)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning: removed null values, encoded categorical features, normalized numerical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): visualized financial distributions and trends.
3. Correlation Analysis: identified key variables influencing revenue and cost.
4. Statistical Modeling: applied regression to predict financial outcomes.
5. Visualization: built clear dashboards to summarize results.

## Results
- Highlighted critical factors affecting revenue and cost variations.
- Improved interpretability of financial performance with visual storytelling.
